# Code Refactor Starter Code
# Horiseon-Search-challenge
# On this challenge, I reconfigured the code elements to represent their true nature within the index file and allow for a concice read of the code.
# I then moved forward to the CSS stylesheet and consolidated many classes into single style selector to remove unecessary repetion. 
# I provided description for each element edit and a bit of context to the reason I made certain decision when picking what to edit.
